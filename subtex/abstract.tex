%This is where the body of your abstract goes, limited to 150 words
%for a thesis, and 350 words for a dissertation or document.  The
%word count limits apply to the regular Abstract in the thesis and
%to the separate Special Abstract.  Use the same text for both; just
%adjust the margins and heading.  The abstract should summarize your
%work.  The UMI booklet listed in the resources section of the U of
%A manual provides some writing tips.  The abstract for a dissertation
%or document may be longer than one page; word count is more important
%than page length in this section.

%If you are doing a paper submission, submit one copy of the special 
%abstract, and two extra copies of your title page, in the box with 
%the final copies of your thesis.  If you are doing an electronic
%submission, you can ignore the special abstract.

The goal of this thesis is to explore the rich subject of magnetism, spin and dipole moments in relativistic mechanics from both a quantum and classical perspective. We explore distinct models of magnetic dipoles from quantum to cosmic scales. We comment on the unique nature of the gyromagnetic ratio $g=2$.

In relativistic quantum mechanics, we investigate the Dirac-Pauli (DP) equation to the Klein-Gordon-Pauli (KGP) equation which are two differing descriptions of fermions. We analyze the homogeneous magnetic field case and the Coulomb problem for hydrogen-like atoms with emphasis on the role of the anomalous magnetic moment (AMM). We further propose extensions to the KGP equation which couple mass and the magnetic moment. Classically, we propose a relativistic covariant model of the Stern-Gerlach force via the introduction of a magnetic four-potential. This model unites the Amp{\`e}rian and Gilbertian models for magnetic dipole moments.

We further study (transition) magnetic dipoles in Majorana neutrinos specifically analyzing the relationship between charge-parity (CP) violation and strong electromagnetic fields. We find the Jarlskog invariant, which characterizes the size of CP violation, to be amplified and/or generated in strong fields. We also show that electromagnetic fields have an effect on neutrino oscillation in the 2-flavor model.

Finally, we cover primordial magnetization in the early universe during the hot dense electron-positron plasma epoch. A model of magnetic dipole polarization thermodynamics is proposed. We analyze the paramagnetic characteristics of the plasma when exposed to an external field. We find that only a small polarization asymmetry is required to generate field strengths in agreement with those measured today.
