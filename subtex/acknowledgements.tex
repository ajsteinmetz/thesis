In my long journey to obtain my PhD, I have benefited from the immense support and friendship of many people in my life. To them I am incredibly grateful.

I first would like to thank Dr. Johann Rafelski who as my PhD advisor guided me on my physics journey towards ever increasing heights of knowledge, understanding, and most importantly a humble awareness of our ignorance towards much of the universe's inner workings. I dearly hope we continue to chip away at those mysteries together.

I also would like to thank Victoria Grossack for hosting many students including myself at her and Dr. Rafelski's lovely home. I promise future gluten-free pies which I am now bound to by the publication of this dissertation.

To my fellow research collaborators, fellow students, and dear friends I also thank for our wonderful time spent together (in alphabetical order): Stefan Evens, Martin Formanek, Christopher Grayson, Will Price, Cheng Tao Yang. I look forward to many more years and publications together.

To friends, to family, and to all who have shown me kindness. Good health and long life to all.
