I dedicate this to everyone blessed with an insatiable curiosity about everything and anything.

\begin{center}
\emph{
    The past, the now, the yet to come,\\
    All the same mechanical sum.\\
    Write down the rules, the laws we borrow,\\
    A glimpse of nature for all tomorrows.\\
}
---A meter of physics\,\\
