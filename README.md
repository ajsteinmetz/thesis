Modern topics in relativistic spin dynamics and magnetism. A Ph.D. dissertation by Andrew James Steinmetz (2023)

## abstract
Magnetism is a rich subject touching all aspects of physics. My goal with this dissertation is to explore spin and magnetic moments in <i>relativistic</i> mechanics from both a quantum and classical perspective. We emphasize the special case of gyromagnetic ratio $g=2$ and its relationship to the algebraic spin structure of wave equations.

In relativistic quantum mechanics, we investigate generalizations of the Dirac equation for arbitrary magnetic moments for fermions. We analyze the homogeneous magnetic field case and the Coulomb problem for hydrogen-like atoms with emphasis on the role of the anomalous magnetic moment (AMM). We explore alternative approaches which combine mass and the magnetic moment. Classically, we propose a relativistic covariant model of the Stern-Gerlach force via the introduction of a magnetic four-potential. This model modifies the covariant torque equations and unites the Ampèrian and Gilbertian models for magnetic moments.

We further study (transition) magnetic dipoles in Majorana neutrinos specifically analyzing the relationship between flavor mixing and electromagnetic (EM) fields. We demonstrate EM flavor mixing explicitly in the 2-flavor model and develop a dynamical mass basis with an EM rotation matrix. EM induced neutrino mass splitting is compared to neutrino mass hierarchy.

An interesting application of these theoretical developments is to study primordial magnetization in the early universe during the hot dense electron-positron plasma epoch. We propose a model of magnetic thermal matter-antimatter plasmas. We analyze the paramagnetic characteristics of electron-positron plasma when exposed to an external primordial field. We determine the magnitude of a small polarization asymmetry is sufficient to generate field strengths in agreement with those measured today in deep intergalactic space.

Future research outlooks include: Second order equations for anomalous quantum chromodynamic (QCD) moments, neutrino CP violation in strong EM fields, and fifth-dimension spin dynamics in Kaluza-Klein theory.
